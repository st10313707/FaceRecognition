        "KNN Classifier is one of the machine learning supervised algorithms used for classification and regression problems. It works by finding the K nearest points in the training dataset and uses their class to predict the class or value of a new data point.\n",

        "**Usage**:\n",
        "We have an image of a celebrity(Nicolas Cage) that we want to classify. We want to know amongst other images of celebrities loaded to predict if the image is similar to Nicolas Cage or not. So for this identification, we can use the KNN algorithm, as it works on a similarity measure.\n",

        "Implementation:\n",
        "1. Prepare a set of images to consider\n",
        "2. Calculate the similarities\n",
        "3. Pass on which features are most important for predicting the class.\n"
